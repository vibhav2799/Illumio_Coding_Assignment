##### Insights

I chose to use data frames and pandas since I have worked analysing data for a Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I feel data frames make this assignment concise and quick. I am using the method of elimination to filter out data which do not match the data within the data frame.

##### Team
I am really interested in working with the Data team, more specifically Data processing and analysis. My interest lies in data discovery. I believe I can apply and hone my existing skills in data analytics further.
